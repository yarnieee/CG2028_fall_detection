@ CG2028 Assignment
@ (c) ECE NUS
@ Write Student 1's Name here: ABCD (A1234567R)
@ Write Student 2's Name here: WXYZ (A0000007X)
@
@ Function prototype:
@   int ewma_filter(int new_data, int old_output, int alpha_percent);
@
@ ARM calling convention:
@   R0 = new_data       (signed integer sensor sample)
@   R1 = old_output     (previous filtered output)
@   R2 = alpha_percent  (integer from 0 to 100)
@   Return R0 = (alpha_percent * new_data
@                + (100 - alpha_percent) * old_output) / 100
@
@ Notes:
@ - Use signed integer arithmetic.
@ - Integer division must truncate towards zero, matching C integer division.
@ - Preserve all callee-saved registers that you use (R4-R11).
@ - Do not call a C helper function and do not use floating-point instructions.
@
@ Register table:
@   R0 ...
@   R1 ...
@   R2 ...
@   R3 ...
@   R4 ...

@ Write your program from here.
